# Autonomous-Waiter-Robot

## Project Overview

An Autonomous Waiter Robot using the TurtleBot3, aimed at executing intricate navigation and service-oriented tasks within simulated hotel and maze environments. This project uses Robot Operating System (ROS2), SLAM using the Cartographer toolkit to meticulously map the surroundings and facilitate accurate localization, the NAV2 navigation framework, which helped the robot with multi-goal path planning abilities, thereby enhancing its operational dynamism. To ensure a thorough and iterative development process, I utilized the Gazebo simulation environment to test and refine the robot's functionalities.
